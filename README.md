# SVG-Logo-Maker

A backend application that employs both inquirer and jest to creat an SVG shape.

## Approach

JavaScript was used to incorporate functionality within the program. The root 'index.js' file utilizes inquirer for question prompts within the terminal. Prompts ask the user for input using text and selecting from a list. A separate .js file renders the answer values into a 'new' Shape that is exported to the logo.svg file. Unit testing of the three shapes is done within the 'shapes.test.js' file.

## Contribution

Tutor Mila Hose assisted in the implementation of the JavaScript in the root 'index.js' file. Google and past activities also aided in the process.
